Setup webpack and babel for this project.

To run the app install all dependencies in the package.json file

and run npm run start

I started this project with the help of Jonas Schmedtmann to learn how to connect API's, dynamically update content on a webpage and setup a real life project with babel & webpack.

I also was very interested to see how axios worked and handled errors.

It has been a fun project to learn from. My goal is to recreate some well-known apps to help me practice and focus more on practicing my technical skills vs thinking of ideas and solving problems as I think up things. I'm very interested in refining my technical skills on a clear project for the next few months before I jump into starting my own stuff. If you have advice or ever need help you can email me at kelleymuro[@]gmail.

This is also my first git project a & repo! It is exciting to push updates and see the changes. Still have a lot to learn when it comes to git and github.
